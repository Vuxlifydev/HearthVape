## 🧠 What Makes Hearthvape Different

Hearthvape is engineered to support **50+ games**, each with its own **custom-styled menu**, tailored logic, and dynamic interface. It doesn’t just run scripts—it understands context, adapts to game environments, and delivers a unique experience per title.

Every module is crafted with precision, and every GUI is styled to match the game’s tone, mechanics, and player expectations. Hearthvape is not a one-size-fits-all client—it’s a smart, branded framework built for longevity and impact.
